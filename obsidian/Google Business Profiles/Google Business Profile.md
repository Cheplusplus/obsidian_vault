## Claim your business profile

If you haven't already you will need to create your business profile before claiming it.
To do this we will sign up on Google My Business. As we are filling out the information the system will provide possible matches for us to choose from.

The other method is for us to locate the Business Profile on Maps and click Claim this business.

If your account is already claimed by someone in your organisation it is possible to add more users to the account.

If someone unknown has claimed your business you will have to request ownership and follow the directions to claim.

If you have multiple locations you will need to create a Business Profile for each.

## Verifying your Business Profile

Verification is the most crucial step. You won't be able to manage your profile until you are verified.

This can be done via phone, email or postcard (which can take up to two weeks to do)

## Add users to your Business Profile account

You don't want to manage your profile by yourself? Not a problem. You can add more users with 3 different levels of access
- Owner (Full permissions)
- Manager
- Site Manager
