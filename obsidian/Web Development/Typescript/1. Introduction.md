TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It is essentially just JavaScript with type checking. All JavaScript source files are valid TypeScript.

TypeScript checks for mistakes at compile time which saves time as you can make changes without having to check in your browser or with unit testing.

Code editors with support for TypeScript also provide code completion and refactoring since the types are known before compilation.

Cons:
- Must be compiled to Javascript. (Transpilation)
- We have to be more disciplined as TypeScript is strict.
