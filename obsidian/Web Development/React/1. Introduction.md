#### What is React?
React is a JavaScript user interface library.
It provides the tools to create dynamic user interfaces with a reusable component based philosophy.
React automates working with the DOM so that we can write HTML code inside of our JavaScript keeping our code concise and readable. React will automatically manage dynamic, asynchronous updating of  our components upon state changes. React also renders on the client machine (Client side rendering).
