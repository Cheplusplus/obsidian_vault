Once you have created a new project the folder structure inside your project is as follows:

- #### App folder
	 The main folder that we created the project in. This folder will have the name which you entered in the Vite setup.
	- #### node modules
		When we install from npm the modules are saved here
	- #### public
		This folder stores the page template static files, images, index.html and other assets which you don't want to be processed by [[Webpack|Webpack]]. Only files inside this folder can be referenced from the HTML ie: `<img src="/img.png">`
	- #### src
		This is the JavaScript entry point, Our components and CSS can be stored here.
		- #### assets
			Static files that will be processed by webpack. These files will not be accessible from the HTML but can be imported into your React app.
		- #### components
			This is where we store our components. This is not required but is convention.
