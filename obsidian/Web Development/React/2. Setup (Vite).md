This process will take you through setting up a React app using Vite.

Download the latest package of node. This will also install npm (update # symbols to latest version):
```console
curl https://nodejs.org/dist/v#.#.#/node-v#.#.#-linux-x64.tar.xz node.tar.xz
```

Unpack the tarball and move the binaries and modules into the correct folders.
```console
tar -xf node.tar.xz

sudo mv node-v#.#.#-linux-x64/bin/* /usr/local/bin/

sudo mv node-v#.#.#-linux-x64/lib/node_modules/ /usr/local/lib/
```

Create a new React app using Vite:
```console
npm create vite@latest
```

You will be prompted for the project name and then to select the type of project you want to start.
After following the prompts you will create a new project in the current folder with the name provided. Change directory into that new folder:
```console
cd project-folder
```

Install the dependencies.
```console
npm i 
```

Run the server to check everything works.
```console
npm run dev
```

Navigate to the address in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```
