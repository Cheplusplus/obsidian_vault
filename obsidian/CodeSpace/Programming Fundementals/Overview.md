Take a minute to answer the questions below:
- Why have you decided to learn programming?
- Do you think it takes a specific type of person to become a successful programmer?
- What habits would you need in order to be a successful programmer? 
- What habits do you currently have that may prevent you from achieving your goals?
- Do you see any limitations that could affect your programming journey negatively?
- Are there specific attributes you hope to develop over the duration of this course?


There are four key techniques to computational thinking:

- **Decomposition** is breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts.
- **Pattern recognition** is looking for similarities among and within problems.
- **Abstraction** is focusing on the important information only, ignoring unnecessary detail and simplifying complexity by hiding internal details from the outside world.
- **Algorithms** are a step-by-step solution to the problem, or a set of rules that need to be followed in order to solve the problem

Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem and breaking it down into a series of small, more manageable problems **[decomposition]**. We can then look at each of these smaller problems individually, and see if similar problems have been solved before **[pattern recognition]**. We then simplify what we are looking at, by only focusing on the important details, and ignoring the unnecessary information **[abstraction]**. And finally create simple steps or rules to solve each smaller problem and work towards solving the bigger problem **[algorithms]**.

Flowcharts:

Advantages:
- Build clarity
- Outlines a complex process
- Communicates ideas quickly
- Increases efficiencies and exposes inefficiencies
- Creates clear documentation
- Helps solve problems
- Enables automation

Disadvantages:
- Creating Flowcharts takes time
- It only accounts for a linear process
- Can get difficult to rearrange
