## Instructions

**Profile Picture:**

- Find a profile image of yourself that includes your waist and shoulders. You are looking for an image that is professional and one you would want prospective employers to see. Make two copies of it.
- Crop the copies so that you have one with just shoulders and face and one with only your face.
- Use the picture element to show the original image on a laptop-sized screen and bigger, the head and shoulders image on a tablet-sized screen and the face image for mobile.

**Hero Image:**

- Create a hero or banner area at the top of your page using the div containing your profile picture, your name and introductory statement. You may resize this div to be any size, but it is recommended for a hero image to take up the full height and width of the screen.
- The hero should make use of a background image, so try to use an image that blends well with the content of your hero or banner. 
- Make use of the CSS background-image properties to ensure it has a backup color property, repeats as many times as you want it to and is in a good position.
