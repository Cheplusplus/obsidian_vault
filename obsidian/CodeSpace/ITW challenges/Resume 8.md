## Instructions

- Use CSS Media Queries to make each div within your resume responsive for different device sizes
- Use at least 3 device sizes so that it is responsive to a mobile, tablet and laptop screen. 
- Add CSS rules and styles to adjust your layouts, padding, margins, etc to ensure that all content is legibly and correctly displayed within the viewport of a user’s screen.
- Ensure images maintain good aspect ratios, content does not overlap each other, and that there is still enough space between elements on your page.
- Ensure that fonts are not too big or too small for the current device.
